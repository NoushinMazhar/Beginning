Code Excersie:

I have put my effort in learning Flickr's API to build a photo search app named "Seach Wand".

This single page app retreives photos from the Flickr upon the user's query. It is implemented using HTML5,CSS3, Javascript and JQuery.

.html file contains the structure of the app and includes all the necessary libraries, needed accordingly.

.css file has the styling layout of the app. I kept it simple and pleasing.

.js file includes all the javascript, ajax method.
